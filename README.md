# System-Security-Client
A project for securing your system with Arduino's motion detection sensors! This is for clients only! If you wish to get the admin side I will seel it to you ;-)

I did this project as a diploma project for a student who was in his final year of Military Institute!

What does this project?
1. Secure a room (like the armory room in my clients case)
2. Detect the motion there
3. Alert the alarm
